<h1>Topic 3: LLM in Healthcare</h1>

<h2>Applications of LLMs in Healthcare</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Summarization
    <ul>
      <li>Summarizes doctor-patient dialogues for easy reference.</li>
      <li>Generates concise visit summaries from patient notes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Entity Recognition
    <ul>
      <li>Extracts Protected Health Information (PHI) from unstructured patient notes.</li>
      <li>Identifies key medical terms and entities for data analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Text Classification
    <ul>
      <li>Classifies clinical documents like PubMed abstracts by type and relevance.</li>
      <li>Determines diagnoses or document categories based on text data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Question Answering
    <ul>
      <li>Supports medical queries with specific answers based on clinical information.</li>
      <li>Facilitates patient and professional inquiries on disease symptoms and treatment options.</li>
