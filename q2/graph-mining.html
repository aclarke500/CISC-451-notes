<h2>Definition of Graphs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A graph is a set of objects (nodes or vertices) where certain pairs of objects are connected by edges.</li>
  <li>Used to model complex systems and relationships in various domains.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Directed Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Edges have a direction, representing a one-way relationship between nodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Undirected Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Edges have no direction, representing mutual relationships between nodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Weighted Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Edges have weights, indicating the strength or cost of the connection between nodes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unweighted Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Edges have no weights; connections are treated as equally significant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Graph Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Social Networks
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling relationships and interactions between people, such as on social media platforms.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Knowledge Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>Storing structured information where entities are nodes and relationships are edges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recommendation Systems
    <ul>
      <li>Utilizing graphs to recommend items by analyzing user-item relationships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Biological Networks
    <ul>
      <li>Modeling relationships between biological entities, such as genes or proteins.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the structure of real-world graphs at the node, edge, and graph levels.</li>
  <li>Key Techniques:
    <ul>
      <li>Centrality Metrics: Measure the importance of nodes within a network (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality).</li>

  <li>Approaches:
    <ul>
      <li>Full Graph Generation: Generate an entire graph structure from scratch.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Static Structural Graph Mining</h1>

<h2>Centrality Metrics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Measures to determine the importance or influence of nodes in a network.</li>
  <li>Common Types:
    <ul>
      <li>Degree Centrality: Counts the number of direct connections a node has.</li>
      <li>Betweenness Centrality: Measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.</li>
      <li>Closeness Centrality: Indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the graph.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Community Detection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identifies clusters or communities within a network.</li>
  <li>Techniques:
    <ul>
      <li>Modularity-Based Methods: Maximize the density of edges within communities and minimize edges between them.</li>
      <li>Spectral Clustering: Uses eigenvalues of matrices associated with the graph to detect communities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Machine learning models that operate on graph structures and leverage node connectivity information.</li>
