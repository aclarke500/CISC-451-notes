<h1>Existing Solutions to Core Challenges in Multi-modal Learning</h1>

<h2>Representation and Fusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fusion Techniques:
    <ul>
      <li>Additive Fusion: Combines features from each modality by summing or averaging.</li>
      <li>Multiplicative Fusion: Uses multiplicative interactions to capture feature dependencies between modalities.</li>
      <li>Tensor Fusion: High-dimensional representation combining features across multiple modalities, though computationally intensive.</li>
      <li>Gated Fusion: Applies attention mechanisms to control the contribution of each modality to the final representation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Applications:
    <ul>
      <li>Late Fusion: Each modality is processed independently, and fusion occurs at the decision level (e.g., ensemble methods).</li>
      <li>Early Fusion: Raw data from each modality is combined at the input level before processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Alignment Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Aligning elements from different modalities to ensure they are synchronized for tasks.
    <ul>
      <li>Discrete Alignment: Used for data with clear structure, like video and transcripts.</li>
      <li>Continuous Alignment: Aligns modalities with continuous data, often through warping techniques.</li>
      <li>Contextualized Representation: Uses attention mechanisms to create representations that capture cross-modal dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Generation Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Text-to-Image Generation: Generates images based on text descriptions (e.g., DALL-E, CLIP).
    <ul>
      <li>Applications include creating visuals for textual descriptions in healthcare, education, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Image-to-Text Generation: Produces textual descriptions based on images (e.g., captioning).
    <ul>
      <li>Useful for accessibility applications and image annotation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
